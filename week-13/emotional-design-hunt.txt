# Production Problem 8: Emotional Design Hunt

## The Problem

First, read the assigned reading from Donald Norman, listed on the ITMD 362 syllabus.

Then, locate a physical object that you use regularly in your life (does not have to be an electronic or digital object), take a photograph of it, and identify in a sentence or two its visceral, behavioral, and reflective levels of emotional design. Then, develop a list of three qualities in that objectâ€™s emotional design that your group might use in your MyIIT redesign project. Be sure to share these with your group.

## Deliverables

A. Photograph of the object (place in the week-12/ directory and commit).

B. Emotional design levels of your object:

* Visceral: This umbrella is colorful which is the reason I bought this one.

* Behavioral: It has a button that not only opens the umbrella but also closes it.  It also wraps up nicely for easy storage.

* Reflective: I own many umbrellas but the Totes brand with the open/close button are my favorite. They can withstand high wind, they are small enough to fit in my car door and they have fun patterns and colors. 

C.  Emotional design qualities of the object that might be useful for Project 3/MyIIT redesign:

1. Colors are very important
2. Convenience and ease of use
3. Even a mundane task should be enjoyable
