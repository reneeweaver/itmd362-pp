# Production Problem 4: Color Palettes for HCI

## The Problem

Using either Adobe Color CC (https://color.adobe.com/), Paletton (http://paletton.com/), or another
Web-based palette generator of your choosing, you will create a number of different color palettes,
based on the requirements in the Deliverables section below.

## Deliverables

Fine-grained, atomic commits to your Production Problems repository that include:

1) screenshots of your web-based palette for the four palettes below;

2) an explanation, after each palette request below, why you chose the colors you did

* A monochromatic palette for a website that creates high-end, custom-made gaming laptops.

Filename: monochromatic_blues
Explanation of your color choices: I went with shades of blue, blue-gray and black.  I think that these colors suggest a sleek, modern design.  It suggests a fast speed, which would be extremely important in high-end gaming laptops.  

* A shaded color palette for a website that sells natural and organic foods.

Filename: shades_green
Explanation of your color choices: I chose shades of green because green suggests plant life and new growth. This would suggest that the natual and organic foods are freshly grown. 

* A complementary palette for a banking website.

Filename: complementary_blue_brown
Explanation of your color choices: I went with blue as my primary color choice because this blue suggests confidence, the complementary color of brown will balance out the shades of blue.  I stayed away from shades of green (the color of money) and red which could mean danger. 

* A triadic palette for a website that offers games for children.

Filename: triad_whimsy
Explanation of your color choices: I chose a collection of blues, pink and brown.  This combination suggests a whimsical tone which would be perfect for games for children.  Children are usually attracted to bright colors which would make them drawn to the website.
